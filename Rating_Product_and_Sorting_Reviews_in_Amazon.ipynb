The solution to this problem means providing greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence of the product for the sellers, and a seamless shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. Since misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product, it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. In the solution of these 2 basic problems, e-commerce sites and sellers will increase their sales, while customers will complete their purchasing journey without any problems.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3m4rNydydMEh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Dataset Story\n","\n","ðŸ“Œ This dataset, which includes Amazon product data, includes product categories and various metadata.
